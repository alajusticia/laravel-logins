# Laravel Logins 🔑

- Track each login, attaching information about the device (device type, device name, OS, browser, IP address) and the context (date, location)
- Save this information in your database, allowing you to display it in the user's account
- Notify users of a new login, along with the information collected
- Offer your users the ability to log out a specific device, all the devices except the current one, or all at once
- Log out a device, without affecting the other remembered devices (each remembered session has its own token)
- You can also enable tracking of Sanctum personal access tokens, useful when authenticating mobile apps for example

## Compatibility

- This package has been tested with Laravel v10 to v12

- It works with all the session drivers supported by Laravel, except the cookie driver which saves the sessions only in
  the client browser and the array driver

- It also supports personal access tokens provided by **Laravel Sanctum (v3)**

## Installation

Install the package with composer:

```bash
composer require alajusticia/laravel-logins
```

Publish the configuration file (`logins.php`) with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="logins-config"
```

Run the `logins:install` command (this will run the required database migrations):

```bash
php artisan logins:install
```

### Prepare your authenticatable models

In order to track the logins of your app's users, add the `ALajusticia\Logins\Traits\HasLogins` trait
in your authenticatable models that you want to track:

```php
use ALajusticia\Logins\Traits\HasLogins;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
// ...

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasLogins;

    // ...
}
```

### Choose and install a user-agent parser

This package relies on a user-agent parser to extract the information.

It supports the two most popular parsers:
- WhichBrowser ([https://github.com/WhichBrowser/Parser-PHP](https://github.com/WhichBrowser/Parser-PHP))
- Agent ([https://github.com/jenssegers/agent](https://github.com/jenssegers/agent)) ⚠️ This one doesn't work with Laravel > v10

Before using Laravel Logins, you need to choose a supported parser, install it and indicate in the configuration file 
which one you want to use.

### Configure the authentication guard

This package comes with a custom authentication guard (`ALajusticia\Logins\LoginsSessionGuard`) that extends the default
Laravel session guard, adding the logic to delete related logins in the `logout()`, `logoutCurrentDevice()` and
`logoutOtherDevices()` methods.

In the `guards` options of your `auth.php` configuration file, use the `logins` driver instead of the `session` driver:

```php
'guards' => [
    'web' => [
        'driver' => 'logins',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
    
    // ...
],
```

### Configure the user provider

This package comes with a modified Eloquent user provider that retrieves remembered users from the logins table,
allowing each session to have its own remember token and giving us the ability to revoke sessions individually.

When using Laravel Logins, you DON'T need to use the `Illuminate\Session\Middleware\AuthenticateSession` middleware for
the "Logout other devices" feature to work. Each login having its own remember token, we don't have to rehash the user
password or to add overhead to check the password hash at every request using the AuthenticateSession middleware.

In your `auth.php` configuration file, use the `logins` driver in the user providers list for the users you want to enable logins:

```php
'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'logins',
        'model' => App\Models\User::class,
    ],
    
    // ...
],
```

### Laravel Sanctum

In addition to sessions, Laravel Logins also supports tracking personal access tokens issued by Laravel Sanctum 
(go to [Compatibility](#compatibility) section for information on supported versions).

This feature can be useful if you are authenticating users from external apps, like mobile apps for example.

> ℹ️ You don't need to enable this if you only track stateful Sanctum authentications (like with Inertia.js).

To enable it, set `sanctum_token_tracking` to `true` in your `logins.php` configuration file.
If Laravel Sanctum is installed after you've installed Laravel Logins, you will have to run the `logins:install` 
command again to update your installation.

When Sanctum tracking is enabled, the `LoggedIn` event is dispatched everytime a token is issued. Also, logins related
to tokens are listed and managed the same way we manage sessions. This implies that, when calling `logoutAll()` method
for example, all sessions AND all personal access tokens will be deleted. This may not be the behavior you want if you
have mixed use cases, and you're also issuing Sanctum personal access tokens for other separated purposes, like API
access. If so, you can define a regular expression in `sanctum_token_name_regex` option of your `logins.php`
configuration file, and only the tokens whose name matches the defined pattern will be tracked as "logins":

```php
'sanctum_token_name_regex' => '/^mobile_app_/',
```

### Laravel Jetstream

If using Laravel Jetstream, you can stop using the `AuthenticateSession` middleware, as it is not necessary with Logins.

In your `jetstream.php` configuration file, set `auth_session` to `null`:

```php
'auth_session' => null,
```

In your routes, remove the middleware:

```diff
Route::middleware([
    'auth:sanctum',
-    config('jetstream.auth_session'),
    'verified',
])->group(function () {
    // ...
});
```

Also, if using the Jetstream with the Livewire stack, the installation command will copy a Livewire component in your
project (if Jetstream has been installed after installing Logins, you will have to run the `logins:install`
command again to update your installation):

![Screenshot of the Livewire component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alajusticia/laravel-logins/main/images/laravel-logins-livewire-component.png "Logins Livewire component")

Files will be copied in `app/Livewire/Logins.php` and `resources/views/livewire/logins.blade.php`.

To use the component, replace the `LogoutOtherBrowserSessionsForm` component of Jetstream, in the profile page
(`resources/views/profile/show.blade.php`) view, by the `Logins` component:

```diff
<div class="mt-10 sm:mt-0">
-    @livewire('profile.logout-other-browser-sessions-form')
+    @livewire('logins')
</div>
```

Feel free to modify the component to suit your needs.

## Usage

The `ALajusticia\Logins\Traits\HasLogins` trait provides your authenticatable models with methods to retrieve and manage
the user's logins.

Everytime a new successful login occurs or a Sanctum token is created, information about the request will automatically
be saved in the database in the `logins` table.

Also, if a notification class is defined in the `logins.php` configuration file, a notification will be sent to your
user with the information.

### Retrieving the logins

#### Get all the logins

```php
$logins = request()->user()->logins;
```

#### Get the current login

```php
$currentLogin = request()->user()->current_login;
```

### Check for the current login

Each login instance comes with a dynamic `is_current` attribute.

It's a boolean that indicates if the login instance corresponds to the login related to the current session or current
personal access token used.

### Revoking logins

#### Revoke a specific login

Using our custom user provider, you have the ability to log out a specific device, because each session has its own 
remember token.

To revoke a specific login, use the `logout` method with the ID of the login you want to revoke. 
If no parameter is given, the current login will be revoked.

```php
request()->user()->logout(1); // Revoke the login where id=1
```

```php
request()->user()->logout(); // Revoke the current login
```

#### Revoke all the logins

We can destroy all the sessions and revoke all the Sanctum tokens by using the `logoutAll` method. 

This feature destroys all sessions, even the remembered ones.

```php
request()->user()->logoutAll();
```

#### Revoke all the logins except the current one

The `logoutOthers` method acts in the same way as the `logoutAll` method, except that it keeps the current
session or Sanctum token alive.

```php
request()->user()->logoutOthers();
```

## IP address geolocation

In addition to the information extracted from the user-agent, you can collect information about the location, based on
the client's IP address.

To use this feature, you have to install and configure this package: [https://github.com/stevebauman/location](https://github.com/stevebauman/location).
Then, enable IP address geolocation in the `logins.php` configuration file.

By default, this is how the client's IP address is determined:

```php
// Support Cloudflare proxy by checking if HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP header exists
// Fallback to built-in Laravel ip() method in Request

return $_SERVER['HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP'] ?? request()->ip();
```

You can define your own IP address resolution logic, by passing a closure to the `getIpAddressUsing()` static method of
the `ALajusticia\Logins\Logins` class, and returning the resolved IP address.

Call it in the `boot()` method of a service provider, for example in your `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`:

```php
\ALajusticia\Logins\Logins::getIpAddressUsing(function () {
    return request()->ip();
});
```

## Events

### LoggedIn

On a new login, you can listen to the `ALajusticia\Logins\Events\LoggedIn` event.

It receives the authenticated model (in `$authenticatable` property) and the `ALajusticia\Logins\RequestContext` object
(in `$context` property) containing all the information collected about the request:

```php
use ALajusticia\Logins\Events\LoggedIn;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;

Event::listen(function (LoggedIn $event) {
    
    // Methods available in RequestContext:
    $event->context->date(); // Returns the date of the login (Carbon object)
    $event->context->userAgent(); // Returns the full, unparsed, User-Agent header
    $event->context->ipAddress(); // Returns the client's IP address
    $event->context->parser(); // Returns the parser used to parse the User-Agent header
    $event->context->location(); // Returns the location (Stevebauman\Location\Position object), if IP address geolocation enabled
    $event->context->tokenName(); // Returns the personal access token name (if Sanctum stateless authentication)
    
    // Methods available in the parser:
    $this->context->parser()->getDevice(); // The name of the device
    $this->context->parser()->getDeviceType(); // The type of the device (desktop, mobile, tablet or phone)
    $this->context->parser()->getPlatform(); // The name of the platform/OS
    $this->context->parser()->getBrowser(); // The name of the browser
})
```

## Notifications

If you want to send a notification to your users when new access to their account occurs, pass a notification class
to the `new_login_notification` option in the `logins.php` configuration file.

Laravel Logins comes with a ready-to-use notification (`ALajusticia\Logins\Notifications\NewLogin`),
or you can use your own.

### Temporarily disable notifications

If you want to disable notifications for a user for the current request, you can set the `notifyLogins` public property
(from the `HasLogins` trait) of your authenticatable model to `false` before logging in the user:

```
$user->notifyLogins = false;

Auth::login($user);
```

## Translations

This package includes translations for English, Spanish and French.

If you want to customize the translations or add new ones, you can publish the language files by running this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="logins-lang"
```

## Purge expired logins

This packages uses [Laravel Expirable](https://github.com/alajusticia/laravel-expirable) to make the Login model
expirable.

To purge expired logins, you can add the `ALajusticia\Logins\Models\Login` class to the `purge` array of the
`expirable.php` configuration file:

```php
    'purge' => [
        \ALajusticia\Logins\Models\Login::class,
    ],
```
